# macro
Excel macros automate repetitive tasks using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). Two common use cases are AutoSort and Data Cleanup, which streamline sorting and removing inconsistencies in datasets.

1. AutoSort Macro

Can trigger on workbook open or button click.

2. Data Cleanup Macro
Purpose: Removes duplicates, blanks, or unwanted formatting to standardize data.

Key Features:

Deletes empty rows/columns.

Trims whitespace and corrects case (e.g., UPPER, Proper).

Fixes errors (#N/A, #VALUE!).
